Because LLMs store a lot of information, the results from searching them can add exponential value to your application without having to write any complex code. It’s one way many applications are being updated with new powerful features.\\nSuperpowered vs. Traditional Search\\nFortunately, vector search is also a faster search approach in more complex scenarios.

Very large general LLMs will have more context, but specialized LLMs for your industry will have more accurate and nuanced information for your business.\\nHow Vector Search is Conducted at Scale\\nAny enterprise system that performs vector search must be able to scale when it goes into production (see our guide to cloud data replication). This makes vector search systems that can replicate and shard their indexes particularly crucial.\\nWhen the system needs to search the index to find matches, the workload can then be distributed across multiple nodes.\\nLikewise, creating new embeddings and indexing them will also benefit from resource isolation, so other application functions are not impacted. Resource isolation means that vector search-related functions have their own memory, CPU, and storage resources.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.couchbase.com/blog/what-is-vector-search/', 'title': 'What Is Vector Search?

For example, table queries, real-time analytics, logging, and data storage services all need their own room to breathe in addition to vector search services.\\nDistributed APIs for LLM access are important, too. As many other services may be calling for embeddings, the APIs and systems producing the embeddings must also be able to grow with more traffic. For cloud-based LLM services, make sure that your production requirements can be met by their service level agreements before you start prototyping.\\nThe use of external services can often scale quickly and efficiently but will require additional funding as it scales higher. Ensure sliding price scales are clearly understood when evaluating options.\\nThe Future of Vector Search'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.couchbase.com/blog/what-is-vector-search/', 'title': 'What Is Vector Search?

Couchbase also discusses its future here.', 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='The Future of Vector Search\\nAdaptive application development will be powered by hybrid search scenarios. A single search or query method will no longer be sufficient for the flexibility needed going forward. Hybrid search capabilities mean you can use vector search to get semantic matches but narrow down results using basic SQL predicates and even geographic queries using a spatial index. \\nCoupling these into a single hybrid search experience will make it easier for developers to extract maximum flexibility from their applications. This will include extending all vector search capabilities to the edge with mobile database integration as well as in the cloud and on-prem.\\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) will allow the developer to add even more customized contextual awareness on top of the LLM. This will reduce the need to retrain an LLM while giving developers the flexibility to keep embedding and matching up to date.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.couchbase.com/blog/what-is-vector-search/', 'title': 'What Is Vector Search?

Large language models (LLMs) are used by machine learning (ML) tools to analyze input data and produce the vector embeddings that describe the data. The vector embedding is then stored in a database or file for another time.\\nWhat is the difference between traditional search and vector search?\\nThe primary difference is that traditional search is optimized for finding precise and exact keyword or phrase matches, whereas vector search is designed to find similar concepts in a more defined context of meaning.\\xa0\\nWhat are the challenges that come with vector search?'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.couchbase.com/blog/what-is-vector-search/', 'title': 'What Is Vector Search?
